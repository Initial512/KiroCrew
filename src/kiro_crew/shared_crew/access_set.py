"""Who may reach this Crew over Tailscale: computed, never typed.

Tailscale is the only access authority. The set of people who get in is
derived, and this module derives it:

* the owner (this machine's own Tailscale user);
* each person who accepted a Crew Tailscale invite, by the login Tailscale's
  API reported for them (``tailscale_invites``);
* each person the owner approved from the Waiting list, by stable Tailscale
  user id;
* once, at the first start, the logins and ``tag:`` entries already in
  ``dashboard.tailscale.allowed_logins`` (the migration seed). After that a hand
  edit of the config list admits nobody.

A same-tailnet person the Tailscale ACL lets reach this machine is not in the
set. The direct tailnet listener refuses them with a "waiting for the owner"
page and :func:`note_waiting` lists them (name, avatar and first sighting from
``whois``) so the owner can Approve or Dismiss them on People. The list is
bounded (:data:`MAX_WAITING`, oldest dropped) and rate-limited.

Removing someone (:func:`stop_access`) refuses their next request, closes their
dashboard sockets, cancels their queued work and stops their running turn
through the admission service's own cancel path, which frees the slot only once
the runtime has stopped. Finished work is kept.

The state file lives in ``<data_home>/.vault/shared-crew-tailscale/`` beside the
invite records, a directory every sandbox mode masks, so an agent's tools can
neither read nor plant an approval. A file that cannot be read admits nobody
but the owner. The computed set is published to
:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.tailnet_live_allowlist`, which the auth middleware
reads.
