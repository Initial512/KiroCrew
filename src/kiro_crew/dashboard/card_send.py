"""A dashboard card's reply, sent as a turn into the crewmate's own thread.

A crewmate's Dashboard tab runs agent-written HTML in a sandboxed frame. The frame
posts ``{type: 'kirocrew-dashboard:send', text}`` to the host, the host calls
``POST /api/chat`` with ``origin: "dashboard_card"``, and :func:`card_send_refusal`
decides here whether that call may go through. A refusal is not an error for the
reader: the host falls back to putting the text in the chat box, which is what the
older ``act`` message always did.

What the server enforces, because the frame cannot be trusted to:

* the caller is the owner's own dashboard (never an app token or a bare internal key);
* the target is an EXISTING crewmate DM thread whose binding matches. The page names
  no target; the host names its own tab's thread, and the server re-checks it;
* the crewmate's ``dashboard_card_send`` setting is on;
* the text obeys the same rules the host applied (trimmed, at most
  :data:`CARD_MAX_CHARS`, no control characters except a newline);
* the thread is idle, with nothing queued, no sub-agent hold, and NO open decision.
  An open tool approval, permission prompt or question card is refused outright. A
  user row retires a question card and a turn start sweeps unresolved permissions,
  so a card turn that got through would count as an answer to something the person
  never saw. Approvals themselves resolve only through their own id-keyed routes,
  which a chat turn cannot reach, so refusing here is what keeps the two apart;
* at most one send per :data:`CARD_MIN_INTERVAL_SECS` per thread.

The turn that does run carries :data:`CARD_TURN_PREFIX` in its text, so the person
sees it in the transcript and the agent reads it, and it is NOT given a person's
authority over session directives. A first word of ``/new`` or ``/clear`` is not a
command either, because the prefix is the first word.
